# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A Python-based cybersecurity tool that evaluates password strength using rule-based validation techniques and common password detection.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Password Strength Checker analyzes user-entered passwords based on multiple security criteria and provides:

- Strength classification (Weak / Medium / Strong)
- Security score
- Percentage rating
- Suggestions for improvement
- Detection of common passwords (blacklist check)

This project demonstrates practical password validation techniques and basic cybersecurity principles.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Minimum length validation (8+ characters)
- Uppercase letter detection
- Lowercase letter detection
- Numeric character validation
- Special character validation
- Common password blacklist checking
- Modular project structure for clean code organization

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- File Handling
- Modular Programming
- Basic Cybersecurity Validation Logic

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Jithendra1828/password-strength-checker.git

2. Navigate to Project Folder:

cd password-strength-checker

3. Run the Program:

python main.py

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The program evaluates password strength based on:

- Length score
- Character variety score
- Blacklist comparison
- Security rules validation

A final score is calculated and classified as:
- Weak
- Medium
- Strong

---

## 📌 Example Output

Enter your password: Pass@123

Strength: Strong  
Score: 8/10  
Security Rating: 85%  
Suggestions: None – Strong password!
